Willis Towers Watson

This repo has two folders.
1. WTWCodeChallengeConsoleProject is a .net console project which will run through a list of emails counting unique emails per the first question. The project then automatically starts a game of tic tac toe.
2. SQL Scripts contains scripts to create and seed tables then perform the requested queries.
